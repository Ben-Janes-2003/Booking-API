# Booking API

A robust and secure RESTful API for a booking system, built with modern .NET 9 and C#. This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end feature set, including JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and full unit and integration test coverage. It is designed to be run containerized with Docker and deployed as Infrastructure as Code.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Role-Based Access Control:** A two-tier permission system with "User" and "Admin" roles, enforced with endpoint authorization.
* **Booking Management:** Authenticated users can create bookings and view their own booking history.
* **Admin Functionality:** Protected endpoints for administrators to create new, bookable time slots.
* **Secure Production Setup:** A one-time, key-protected endpoint for securely creating the initial admin user in a new environment.
* **Fully Tested:** Comprehensive unit tests (xUnit, Moq) for business logic and integration tests (`WebApplicationFactory`) for security and pipeline validation.
* **Containerized:** Fully configured to run locally with a single Docker Compose command.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET 9 SDK
* Docker Desktop

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```

2.  **Create your environment file:**
    In the root directory, create a `.env` file. This file holds the secrets for your local environment and is ignored by Git. Copy the contents below and replace the placeholder values with your own strong, random keys.

    ```env
    DB_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword123!
    JWT_KEY=YourSuperLongAndSecretJwtKeyGoesHere
    JWT_ISSUER=https://localhost:8081
    ADMIN_SETUP_KEY=YourSuperSecretAdminSetupKeyGoesHere
    ```

3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    Execute the following command from the root of the project to build and start the API and database containers.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. You can access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger`.
